# angularjs-php-launch-application

** Apparently there is some issue uploading the files. **

** I put all the files in the launch.zip and you can extract the files **

** The img preview folder contain images of the front end & admin section. **

== Description ==

Launch template is landing page.

I add/modify the template and writing it to angularjs & php code.

The Launch landing page for people to sign up for promotions or discount/sales or events.

Then you can export the emails from the admin section and upload to your Email Marketing platform.

This is the design template I used is from freehtml5:

https://freehtml5.co/demos/launch/

Once you log in to the admin section, there are 7 pages:

1. index page is where you enter the upcoming events.
2. Email page is where you see the collection of emails.
3. Header page is where you enter the info for the landing page.
4. Social1 page is where to enter the social media links.
5. Social2 page is where to enter the social media links.
6. Date page is where to set the count down for the promotions or discount/sales or events.
7. Upload page is where you upload the background image for the landing page

== Instructions ==

Before you upload the angularjs.sql file to phpmyadmin

Open the file and change the username and password.

Then export all the files into your domain (for example www(dot)yourcompanyname(dot)com)

To access the admin section: www(dot)yourcompanyname(dot)com/launch_admin/

For Marketing & SEO suggestion:

You can buy another domain for landing page for example: discount.yourcompanyname.com / sale.yourcompanyname.com / events.yourcompanyname.com

Enter the info on Facebook and Twitter integration or other social media integration on the index.php

Post the link on Facebook, Twitter and etc...

Add Google Analytics on the index.php to keep track all of clicks.

The Email Marketing platform keep track of the clicks when you send out the promotional emails.

== Languages and Software==

These are the languages I used to create the landing page:

Language: HTML, CSS, JQuery/Ajax, AngularJS, OOP PHP

Software: Atom & Gimp
